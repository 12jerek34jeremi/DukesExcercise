# Dukes Exercise
The "Dukes Exercise" application was written by me using Android Studio completely in Kotlin. It is available on the [Play Store (link)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=zahenta.dukesexercise). If you prefer watching rather than reading and you know polish, then instead of reading this file, you can watch [this video]((https://drive.google.com/file/d/14v1DTA3-rx1C68ehiJzEjY5w-fsN8ktP/view?usp=share_link)) where I demonstrate how the application works and how to use it. Video is in polish, beacuse app's user interface is in polish.

### What the application does

The application can be used to train dodges before punches. The application randomly selects one of the six punches (left/right straight/uppercut/hook), "says" the name of the punch, and the user's task is to perform the appropriate dodge. In the "interval" field, the user can set a time between consecutive punches. For example, if the interval field is set to 2.0 seconds, then, after first punch, application will wait 2.0 seconds before selecting a second punch.<br/>

The user can choose which punches will be selected with greater probability and which with smaller probability. This is done by setting the relative probabilities of each punch. After pressing "Start," the application sums the relative probabilities of all punches. Then, in each selection, the probability of selecting a given punch is equal to the relative probability of that punch divided by the sum of all relative probabilities. For example, after setting the probabilities as shown in the above image, the probability of selecting each punch will be the same, i.e., 1/6. However, after setting the probabilities as shown in the image below, the "left straight" punch will be selected with a probability of 0.75, the "right straight" punch with a probability of 0.25, and the other punches will not be selected.<br/>

The application automatically saves its state (the values of all probabilities and interval). After closing and reopening the application, the values of all probabilities and interval will be exactly the same as before closing.
